# Guessing Game

- Exposure to many Rust concept using a simple number guessing project such as:
    - Installing Dependencies
    - Mutable and Immutable Variable
    - Parsing mutable variable reference into a function
    - String formating during `println!` macro
    - Handling potential failure using `.expect()`
    - Pattern matching using `match <pattern>`
    - Usage of `std::cmp::Ordering` enums
    - Data-type conversion using `.parse()` with annotated variable type
    - Shadowing of variable to avoid duplicated variable name
    - Usage of `Ok()` and `Err()` pattern for potential failure
    - Infinite loop with `continue` and `break`
